# Spatial Data Scientist

## About Me
I am a graduate of the University of California, Santa Barbara, with a Bachelor of Science in Physical Geography, emphasizing Ocean Science. My academic background includes spatial data analysis, spatial statistics, imagery analysis, and environmental analysis.

Proficient in ArcGIS, Python, MATLAB, and SQL, I am passionate about leveraging my skills in data acquisition, manipulation, and analysis to solve complex problems. I am actively seeking a career in spatial data analysis or data analysis, where I can apply my technical expertise and contribute to impactful projects.

#### Technical Skills: Python, SQL, ArcGIS Pro, MATLAB

### Exploring Spatial Patterns of NYC Citi Bike Usage

Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.

### Bay Area Housing Spatial Analysis

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
